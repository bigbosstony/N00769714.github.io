Proposal
--------

Jan 30, 2017

*Proposal for the PiGPS Tracker Project*

*Prepared by Yan Yu*

Computer Engineering Technology Student

### **Executive Summary** 

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for detecting the location by using a GPS module.
The database will store the history of locations. The mobile device
functionality will include a real time location tracking and will be further
detailed in the mobile application proposal. I will be collaborating with the
following company/department Humber Department of Public Safety. In the winter
semester I have no plan to form a group with the following students, who are
also building similar hardware this term and working on the mobile application
with me. The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production
Techniques independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319
Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in
CENG 355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

###**Background**

The problem solved by project is to prevent car stolen. With this portable
tracking device that you can easily install in your car, if your car was stolen,
you can track your car using this tracker, and it will have a real time tracking
system which you can access on your mobile app. This will help the police to
catch the thief faster.

 

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read [2] which provides insight into
similar efforts.

 

The first article I found discusses how. [@6034650]

The second journal talks about.

The third article gives the information.

 

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

• Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

• Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

• Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to Software
Engineering,

• Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

• SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

• Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

• Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

 

### **Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
                  Phase 1 Hardware build.  
                  Phase 2 System integration.  
                  Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

 

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

 

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

 

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

### **Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for Parking Lot.
This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our
program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project demonstrating my ability
to learn how to support projects such as the initiative described by [3]. I
request approval of this project.

1. Introductionn
==================
2. Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)
========================================
2.1 Product Description
------------------------

### 2.1.1 Goal

This project will combine Raspberry Pi and a GPS module together to make a portable GPS tracking device.
As the device is running, the gps module will keep updating the current location to the server, and users can 
access those data by their smartphone.

### 2.1.2 Targeted Users

This real time tracking devce is for vehicles track down, for people who go out for hiking or biking, for kids and 
elderly.

### 2.1.3 Overview Of Product

PiGPS Tracker includes a Raspberry 2 Model B, a GPS module, battery power supply(Or rechargable battery pack), GPS
Antenna(if needed), USB to TTL Adapter.

2.2 System Perspective
------------------------

### 2.2.1 Product Perspective

The product will be written by Python on the Raspberry Pi side, for the mobile application, It will support 
android and ios platform.

### 2.2.2 Product Functionality

Tha main functionality of my product is to provide user the location of the device for user to track it. It will help them to 
find their stolen car, or the people who needed help.

### 2.2.3 Requirements

Internet connection is needed to upload location information to the database. If you take it with you a battery supply will be required,
or if you placed it in the car, power supply will be needed. To achieve the best performace of the product, a GPS antenneis recommended 
to recieve a stable and strong signal of the GPS.

2.3 Overall Description
------------------------
### 2.3.1 System Interface

System Interface for my project includes GPS module, database server, and mobile application. When the system is power up, a python software should autamatically run as dufault, it will collect all the gps data and send it to the server if there is a internet connection. User can track down the real time location update by using the application on thier cellphone. User can also manege all the data from the server, they can decided to keep it or delete it.

### 2.3.2 Database

PiGPS Tracker uses Google's Firebase Database, which easily for android application development. One device can only connect to one root user who has all the authorization to the data. Root user can see all the data and decide to keep it or not. Other users will need autherization from the root user to access the data and can only see it for the last 24 hours. User will see a real map on their app which powered by Google Maps.

### 2.3.3 Hardware

The main process of this project is collec data by using the GPS module and then raspberry pi micro-computer will upload it to the server, mostly is the longitude and latitude.

### 2.3.4 Software

User needs a account to connect to the tracker. The first User conect to the device will be the root user, and one device can only have one root user, but user can have multiple devices.  Once the data is uploaded, user will see the tracker on thier map application.
User (root) can manage all the data on the server, they will have a email address as the login name, a password more than 6 digit, they can also change it after sign up successfully.
