Proposal
--------

Jan 30, 2017

*Proposal for the PiHue Project*

*Prepared by Yan Yu*

Computer Engineering Technology Student

### **Executive Summary** 

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. This project mainly focus on the connection between
raspberry pi and Philips Hue. I will be collaborating with the following
company/department Humber Department of Public Safety. In the winter semester I
have no plan to form a group with the following students, who are also building
similar hardware this term and working on the mobile application with me. The
hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques
independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software
Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355
Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

### **Background**

By using this project, you can automatically turn on your lamp when you get
home.

 

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read which provides insight into similar
efforts.

 

The first article I found discusses how to set up your own database by using PHP
& MySQL.[@1510592]

The second journal talks about GPS-Based Tracking Control for a Car-Like Wheeled
Mobile.[@4598867]

The third article gives the information about how to merge GPS information to a
real map.[@5702361]

 

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

• Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

• Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

• Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to Software
Engineering,

• Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

• SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

• Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

• Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

 

### **Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
                  Phase 1 Hardware build.  
                  Phase 2 System integration.  
                  Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

 

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

 

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

 

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

1. Introductionn
================

1.1 Purpose
-----------

The purpose of this documentation is to give a description of the “PiHue" in
both hardware requirements and software side. It will also contain a
explaination of the application.

1.2 Scope
---------

The main use of PiHue is to help you control your lights in your home.

In beta phase, after set up the system, you can easily control your Hue through
raspberry pi.

In final phase of PiHue, not only raspberry pi can control Hue, but also your
smartphone.

2. Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)
=============================================

2.1 Product Description
-----------------------

### 2.1.1 Goal

This project will combine Raspberry Pi, Philips Hue and the bridge, connect all
the device by internet. Control lights using smartphone.

### 2.1.2 Targeted Users

Tech-fans, with modern technology to build smart home accessories.

### 2.1.3 Overview Of Product

PiHue includes a Raspberry 2 Model B, Philips Hue bulbs, bridge, an android or
iOS device and a router.

2.2 System Perspective
----------------------

### 2.2.1 Product Perspective

The product will be written by Python on the Raspberry Pi side, for the mobile
application, It will support android and ios platform.

### 2.2.2 Product Functionality

Tha main functionality of my product is to provide user to control lights in
your own home.

### 2.2.3 Requirements

Internet connection is needed to send command and script to bridge to turn on or
off the lights. A router will be needed to build a secure line for the bridge.

2.3 Overall Description
-----------------------

### 2.3.1 System Interface

System Interface for my project includes raspberry pi and a smartphone. A web
based database is for mobile connection. GPS module will be simulated by the
smartphone.

### 2.3.2 Database

Website using JSON.

### 2.3.3 Hardware

The main process of this project is to understand communication of Hue bridge.

### 2.3.4 Software

User will use raspberry pi and smartphone to integrate with the bridge.

2.4 Build Instruction
---------------------

### 2.4.1 Introduction

Understanding how Philips Hue works, and hack Hue bridge with raspberry pi then
set up connection with smartphone. This build instruction adopted from [Randy
Reed](https://www.hackster.io/randywreed) from
[hackster](https://www.hackster.io/randywreed/unlock-phillips-hue-with-ifttt-maker-raspberry-pi-e768bc).

### 2.4.2 Preparation

Start up with Philips Hue API, you can check out the API from Philips. Also a
hue library for raspberry pi is needed. phue and pyhue.

|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hue library and other software installation | (1 hr) I take this amount of time to find out the proper library for the system.                             |
| Hue bridge connection                       | (1 hr) I using meethue.com to find out the unique ID for the bridge and testing the command with the bridge. |
| Sample code testing                         | (30 mins) Error fixing.                                                                                      |

### 2.4.6 Software Installation

Two kinds of libraries for pi I found is
[pyhue](https://github.com/aleroddepaz/pyhue) and
[phue](https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue).

**pyhue:** `pip install pyhue`

**phue:** `sudo easy_install phue` or `pip install phue`

### 2.4.7 System Setup

Using [www.meethue.com/api/nupnp](www.meethue.com/api/nupnp) to discover the IP
address and ID of the bridge.

Go to <http://ip_address_you_found/debug/clip.html>.

Address `http://<bridge ip address>/api`

URL `/api`

Body `{“devicetype”:”my_hue_app#pi tony”}`

Press the button on the bridge and then press **POST** button to generate the
unique ID.

Address `http://<bridge ip address>/api/unique_id/lights`

Body

**GET**

Address `http://<bridge ip address>/api/unique_id/lights/1` \\

Body

**GET**

Address `http://<bridge ip address>/api/unique_id/lights/1/state`
