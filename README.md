Proposal
--------

*Proposal for the SmartParkingLot Project*

Prepared by Yan Yu
*Computer Engineering Technology Student* 

**Executive Summary**

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom PCB with sensors and actuators for _detective car entry, taking pictures and trigger the parking gate_. The database will store the number plates. The mobile device functionality will include _checking the plate number and parking time and will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal. I will be collaborating with the following company/department _Humber Department of Public Safety_. In the winter semester I plan to form a group with the following students, who are also building similar hardware this term and working on the mobile application with me _____Thomas Chang, Alisha Singh Chauhan. The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.
