Previous Project Description
============================

During the fifth semester me and my group members have been working on a project
called Smart Parking Lot. The full project would has the functions to taking
pictures of vehicles’ licenses plates and then open the gate or close the gate
let the vehicle enter or exit automatically. However, due to the cancellation of
the project in this semester, I started on my own project by myself. You can
check out my previous project on this website <https://bigbosstony.github.io>.

Proposal
========

Jan 30, 2017

*Proposal for the PiHue Project*

*Prepared by Yan Yu*

Computer Engineering Technology Student

### **Executive Summary** 

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will working with the software running on
raspberry pi system. This project mainly focus on the connection between
raspberry pi and Philips Hue. I will be collaborating with the following
company/department Humber Department of Public Safety. In the winter semester I
have no plan to form a group with the following students, who are also building
similar hardware this term and working on the mobile application with me. The
hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques
independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software
Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355
Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

### **Background**

By using this project, you can automatically turn on your lamp when you get
home.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read which provides insight into similar
efforts.

The first article I found discusses how to control devices through wireless
transmission[@7845398].

The second journal talks about design of smart home control system by Internet
of Things based on ZigBee[@7603564].

The last one is a breakdown of Amazon echo digital personal assistant[@7098621].

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

• Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

• Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

• Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to Software
Engineering,

• Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

• SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

• Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

• Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

### **Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
                  Phase 1 Hardware build.  
                  Phase 2 System integration.  
                  Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.  
*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

or a ethernet switch used to create the local network.

### 2.3.2 Hardware

The main process of this project is to understand communication of Hue bridge.

### 2.3.3 Software

User will use raspberry pi to integrate with the bridge.

2.4 Build Instruction
---------------------

### 2.4.1 Introduction

Understanding how Philips Hue works, and hack Hue bridge with raspberry pi then
set up connection between raspberry pi and the bridge. I have searched through
the internet for a proper installation on raspberry pi and found this build
instructions adopted from [Randy Reed](https://www.hackster.io/randywreed) on
[hackster](https://www.hackster.io/randywreed/unlock-phillips-hue-with-ifttt-maker-raspberry-pi-e768bc).

### 2.4.1.1 Bridge

The bridge used to enable your smart bulbs to communicate with other devices via
the internet. The main API offered by the bridge can be accessed when your app
and bridge are on the the local network. Also I noticed the bridge’s ethernet
cable wiring is different than the standard TIA/EIA 568B Wiring.

### 2.4.1.2 Bulbs and ZigBee

These smart bulbs contain 3 types of LED specifically chosen to produce a range
of colours and intensities. The bulbs I use is Philips Hue White A19 Bulbs. They
are connected to the bridge via an open standards protocol called ZigBee Light
Link. ZigBee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level
communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small,
low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical device data
collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs. You can find more
information on the developers’ website <http://www.zigbee.org>.

### 2.4.2 Preparation

Start up with Philips Hue API, you can check out the API from Philips
<https://www.developers.meethue.com>. Also a hue library for raspberry pi is
needed, I found two libraries on GitHub, you can choose one of them or both:
[phue](https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue) and
[pyhue](https://github.com/aleroddepaz/pyhue).

### 2.4.2.1 Hardware Wiring and Network Setup

Connect raspberry pi and the bridge in the same network area location is very
easy to do in your house network, just connect raspberry pi wireless or wired to
the router, and connect the bridge to the router wired, and you are ready to go.

But in a public area, it’s could be difficult to do. In Humber College, I tried
to connect raspberry pi to the college WiFi, however, raspberry pi does not
recognized by our network, and can not be configured. The reason is Humber uses
a PEAP(Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) network protocol, this
protocol is a high level protected communication channel. It requires a
server-side PKI certificate to create a secure TLS tunnel to protect user
authentication and use server-side public key certificates to authenticate the
server.

To solve this question, I set up a router at school, by creating your own
network and set up your protocol, it it possible to connect bridge and raspberry
pi in the same network. I used a [AirPort
Express](http://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MC414AM/A/airport-express?fnode=58),
you can easily set up and administrate this router from your Mac or iOS devices.

Finally, using AirPort Express is one way to set up your network, but I
discovered a new way and the best way to handle this situation. Taking your
raspberry pi outside to test your project can be messed up, you have to connect
power cable, keyboard, mouse and a display. Then you have to set up your router
and bridge, this process is possible but not convenience. I found a short cut to
do this. You will set up the connection to by the following diagram.

\~………………..MacBook (Ethernet port or Adaptor)…………..\~

\~………………………….\| Ethernet cable \|………………………..……..\~

\~………………..Ethernet switch \<=\> power adaptor…………..\~

\~………………………….\| Ethernet cable \|………………………………..\~

\~………………….//…………………………………………\\\\……………………..\~

\~…..The bridge \<=\> power adapter \<=\> raspberry pi…..\~

 

Next, you need to configure your network setting on your MacBook.

Go to your System Preferences, then select Sharing, on the Internet Sharing
section, turn on Ethernet Port or Ethernet adapter then turn on Internet
Sharing. Now open VNC Viewer(download from <https://www.realvnc.com>), (your
raspberry pi should be configured to turn on VNC server), enter the server
address normally 192.168.2.2, and you are connected to raspberry pi and can use
your MacBook’s keyboard, trackpad and display. The bridge’s IP address would be
192.168.2.3.

### 2.4.6 Hardware Installation

### 2.4.6.1 PiTFT Plus Touchscreen Installation (Option/Archived)

For easy way to control the bridge using raspberry pi, you can install a
touchscreen. I used PiTFT Plus 480x320 3.5” TFT+Touchscreen from
[adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2441). The installation process is
follewed by
[adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-3-dot-5-touch-screen-for-raspberry-pi/easy-install).
I choose easy install option which you can download the fully prepared image
from the website above. After that you will start up a fresh sd card, use
SDFormater to formate your sd card. Then I used ApplePi Baker(you can find other
useful tools on <http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup>) to burn the image to
the sd card. After that plug in your sd card to the raspberry pi and you are
ready to start using the touchscreen.

[Update] I noticed if you update your raspberry pi to the latest version, it
will overwrite the configuration file of the touchscreen, and the raspberry pi
will stuck at the booting section leave a black screen. I suggest you to follow
section 2.4.2.1 for the setup.

### 2.4.7 Software Installation

### 2.4.7.1 System Update

forst, update you system’s package list by:

`sudo apt-get update`

Next, upgrade all your installed packages to their latest versions with the
command:

`sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`

### 2.4.7.2 Library Installation

Two kinds of libraries for pi I found is
[pyhue](https://github.com/aleroddepaz/pyhue) and
[phue](https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue).

**pyhue:** `pip install pyhue`

**phue:** `sudo easy_install phue` or `pip install phue`

**requests:** `sudo apt-get install python-pip`

`sudo pip install requests`

### 2.4.7.3 Other Requirement

3.0 Conclusion
==============

As the smartphone has been the most important device we use everyday, and
network based assistant is already taking place of so many area, like Google
Now, Siri and Amazon echo. These smart devices are entering your house. With
Philips Hue, it is possible to control lights in your home by your cellphone or
just your voice. This project is focus on hacking the Hue bridge using raspberry
pi through a local network.

Learning how the bridge is talking with the Philips Hue Bulbs is the key for
this program. I simplified on the programming side, set up the connection
between raspberry pi and the bridge by using python. There are multiple ways to
do so. I first use IFTTT which is the easiest way to get connection with the
bridge. The whole process is done by ZigBee protocol, and I am coding on the
raspberry pi by python and existed hue library provided by GitHub.

The project gives you the freedom to use your lights and discover the
possibility to extend ways to use Philips Hue.
